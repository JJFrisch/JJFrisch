## About Me
I‚Äôm a dual-degree student in **Computer Science & Physics** at the University of Maryland. My work spans **software development**, **AI research**, and **hardware prototyping**. I have a passion for solving complex problems and I am looking to get involved in bioinformtaics. When I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me playing pick-up soccer or reading a fantasy novel.

- **Languages & Tools:** Python, C, C++, Java, C#, Rust, Assembly, JavaScript, Linux  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, .NET MAUI, Unity, SolidWorks  
- **Skills:** Neural networks, data analysis, visualization, system design, problem framing
